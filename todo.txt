+Scale
	-Doesn't sample at other 3d coordinates but resample the same texture at different longitudes/latitudes
+Turbulence
	-Doesn't sample 3d perlin directly but resample the texture at another coordinate (might change this later)
+Terrace
	-Code it
+Curve
	-Fix it
+Voronoi
	-render plain color on gpu render.
+ScaleBias
	-is it really working ?
+Select
	-Really need to implement fallof (useless gpu node otherwise).
+Displace
	-Need more checks otherwise it seems that it doesnt' have a proper behaviour (weird checker thing happening...)
+Rotate
	-Z doesn't work
	-Is this the expected behaviour ?
+Turbulence
	-It seems like this node rotate / stretch the texture somehow... need a fix asap
